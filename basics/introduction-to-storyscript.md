# ðŸ“ª Introduction to StoryScript

In StoryScript, the main files are `.sscript` files. They are stored in the `<Minecraft folder>/SScripts` path. You can create script files yourself. File names cannot contain characters , `/`, `:`, `"`, `<`, `>` and `|`. You can also put scripts in folders, so it will be easier to navigate your scripts.

## Running the script

Scripts are run using the `/ss <path_for_script>` command. For example: `/ss New story/My script` runs the script at the path `<Minecraft folder>/SScripts/New story/My script.sscript`.
