# ðŸ“ª Introduction to StoryScript

In StoryScript, the main files are `.sscript` files. They are stored in the `<Minecraft folder>/sscripts` path. You can create script files yourself. File names cannot contain characters , `/`, `:`, `"`, `<`, `>` and `|`. You can also put scripts in folders, so it will be easier to navigate your scripts.

## Running the script

Scripts are run using the `/sscript run <script>` (`/ss <path_to_script>` in earlier versions) command. For example: `/sscript run example` runs the script at the path `<Minecraft folder>/sscripts/example.sscript`.
